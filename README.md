# SwiftyFlags

Swifty flags is a reference of all Swift compiler flags per toolchain version. It allows one to lookup which flags are "upcoming" and which ones are "experimental".

Every feature also has a search link to lookup related Swift evolution proposals.

The way it works is by periodically scraping the Swift source repository, looking up all `LANGUAGE_FEATURE`, `EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE` and `UPCOMING_FEATURE` flags.
